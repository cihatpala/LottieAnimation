## ðŸ“¦ Dependency Management

We use **Gradle Version Catalog** for clean and centralized dependency management.

### `libs.versions.toml`

```toml
# Lottie version
lottie-ver = "6.6.6"

# Lottie Compose dependency
lottie = { group = "com.airbnb.android", name = "lottie-compose", version.ref = "lottie-ver" }
```
